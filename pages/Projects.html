    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <div class="box" div>I have three projects from previous years in computer science. The first is a game where the screen flashes different colors as the mouse moves. The second is a game where you try to click a box that is always moving. The last is a collection of minigames created by Beren. I currently have a few projects in progress. I am working on expanding Quit The Game: The Game and possibly adding a win condition. I am also working on a game where you play as a tank. More projects will be added in the future.</div>
